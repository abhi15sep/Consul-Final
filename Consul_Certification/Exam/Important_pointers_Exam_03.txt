Module 21: Key-Value in Consul:
==============================
Objects are opaque to Consul, meaning there are no restrictions on the type of object stored in a key/value entry. The main restriction on an object is size - the maximum is 512 KB.
If you want to list all the keys, consul kv get -recurse command can be used.

Command                                     Description
consul kv put max_memory 512MB              Add 512MB in max_memory key
consul kv get max_memory                    fetch the contents of max_memory
consul kv get -recurse                      Feth all the keys

Module 22: API Endpoint for KV:
===============================
By default, the returned value from API is a base64-encoded blob of data
> curl --header "X-Consul-Token:3456565524324234323254654345232" http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/db?pretty 

After using ?raw
> curl --header "X-Consul-Token:3456565524324234323254654345232" http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/db?raw
password


Module 23: Find list of all keys via API:
=========================================
The keys specify to return only keys (no values or metadata). Specifying this implies recurse.
This is specified as part of the URL as a query parameter.

> curl --header "X-Consul-Token:3456565524324234323254654345232" http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/?keys
["db","key-1","key-2","key-3"]


Module 24: Consul Template:
===========================
Consul Template queries a Consul instance and updates any number of specified templates on the filesystem
Consul Template is not part of the consul binary.Can be used with -once to run only once.

   Template
{ key "course-name" }   <------> Consul    <---------->  key          value  
output: consul01                                         course-name  consul01


Module 25: Consul Watches:
==========================
Watches feature in Consul checks for changes made to the Consul resource.
When an update is detected, an external handler is invoked.
Watch functionality can watch for a wide variety of resources, these include:

key
keyprefix
services
nodes
checks
events

Module 26: Prepared Query:
===========================
You should be able to identify differences in a service definition and prepared query.
Endpoint: web-service.query.consul

Service definition:
{
    "service": {
        "name": "web",
        "id": "web2",
        "port", 9080,
        "tags": ["v2"]
    }
}

Prepared Query:

{
    "Name": "web-Service",
    "Service": {
        "Service": "Web",
        "Tags": ["v2"]
    }
}

Module 27: Prepared Query - Failover Policy:
===========================================
Consul servers in the local datacenter will attempt to find healthy instances of the "database" service within the dc1
If none are available locally, the Consul servers will make an RPC request to the Consul servers in "singapore" to perform the query there.
Finally, an error will be returned if none of these datacenters had any instances available.

{
    "Name": "failover",
    "Service": {
        "Service": "database",
        "Tags": ["v1"],
        "Failover": {
            "Datacenters": ["singapore"]
        }
    }
}

Module 28: Backup & Restore:
============================
Consul provides the snapshot command that saves a point-in-time snapshot of the state of the Consul servers. 
Some of the important data includes:

Key-Value entries
the service catalog
prepared queries
sessions
ACLs

Commands                               Description
consul snapshot save backup.snap       Takes backup and stores it to backup.snap file.
consul snapshot restore backup.snap    Restore data from the backup.


Module 29: Overview of Consul Enterprise:
=========================================
Consul Enterprise includes capabilities that improve failure resilience, read scalability, and managing access in accordance with organizational policies.

Some of the unique features include:
Audit Logging
Automated Backups
Namespaces
Redundancy Zones
Automated Upgrades
Enhanced Read Scalability
Sentinel

Module 30: Redundancy Zones:
============================
Redundancy zones is a Consul autopilot feature that makes it possible to run one voter and any number of non-voters in each defined zone.

voters                      voters                  voters
consul01 <-------------->   consul02 <---------->   consul03
   |                           |                       |
   |                           |                       |
   |                           |                       |
Consul04                    Consul05                 Consul06       
non-voters                  non-voters               non-voters

  A-Z1                         A-Z2                     A-Z3

If only the voter is lost in an availability zone, the autopilot will promote the non-voter to voter automatically, putting the hot standby server into service quickly.

Non-voting servers still receive data from the cluster replication, however, they do not take part in quorum election operations.

Module 31: Important Pointers for Quorum:
=========================================
We should maintain an odd number of nodes within the cluster.

Cluster Size  Majority  Fault Tolerance
1                0             0         
2                2             0  
3                2             1
4                3             1
5                3             2
6                4             2
7                4             3


Module 32: Consul Snapshot Agent:
=================================
Consul Snapshot Agent is an enterprise-only feature that automatically manages on taking snapshots, backup rotation, and sending backup files offsite to Amazon S3
Consul Enterprise enables you to run the snapshot agent within your environment as a service like systemd.

> consul snapshot agent

Module 33: Default Ports in Consul:
===================================
Consul uses the following ports for communication.

Port Number                   Description
8600(TCP and UDP)             DNS server
8500 (TCP)                    HTTP API (GUI as well)
8501                          HTTPS API
8301(TCP and UDP)             Handle gossip in the LAN
8302(TCP and UDP)             Used by servers to gossip over the WAN 
8300 (TCP only)               Server RPC to handle incoming requests from other agents
21000 to 21255                Min and Max port for sidecar service


Module 34: Namespaces:
======================
Namespaces provide separation for teams within a single organization enabling them to share access to one or more Consul datacenters without conflict.
