Module 35: Methods for Distributing Certificates:
=================================================
There are two methods for distributing client certificates: operator and auto encryption
With auto-encryption, you can configure the Consul servers to automatically distribute certificates to the clients.
This method stores the certificates in memory, they are not persisted.

The operator method is recommended if you need to use a third-party CA


Module 36: Gossip Encryption in Existing DC :
============================================

1. verify_incoming - If set to true, consul requires that all incoming connections make use of TLS and that the client provides a certificate signed by a certificate authority from the ca_file or ca_path.

2. verify_outgoing - If set to true, consul requires that all outgoing connections from this agent make use of TLS and that the server provides a certificate signed by a certificate authority from the ca_file or ca_path.

3. verify_server_hostname - If set to true, consul verifies for all outgoing TLS connections that the TLS certificate presented by the servers matches server.<datacenter>.<domain> hostname.


Module 37: Rotating Gossip Encryption keys:
=========================================== 
There are four primary steps for the entire process of gossip key rotation.
Generate a new encryption key.
Add new key to the keyring
Promote new key to primary
Remove old key from the keyring.

> Consul keyring -list

Module 38: Approaches to Join Servers:
======================================
There are multiple options for joining the servers.
Specify a list of servers with -join and start_join options.
Specify a list of servers with -retry-join option.
Use automatic joining by tag for supported cloud environments with the -retry-join.

Module 39: Cloud Auto-Join:
===========================
retry-join accepts a unified interface using the go-discover library for automatically joining a Consul datacenter using cloud metadata.

Module 40: envconsul:
=====================
Envconsul provides a convenient way to launch a subprocess with environment variables populated from HashiCorp Consul and Vault.

Key             value
address         1.2.3.4
max_conns       5
port            80
        |
        |
envconsul -prefix my-app env | egrep 'address|port|max_conns'


Module 41: Sidecar Proxy Support - Consul Connect:
==================================================
Consul includes its own built-in Layer 4 (L4) proxy for testing and development but also offers first-class support for Envoy as a sidecar proxy.

Envoy is an open-source edge and service proxy.
It comes with various additional features, some of these include:
Support for HTTP/2 and gRPC
Advanced Load Balancing
Deep observability of L7 traffic


Module 42: Reloadable Configuration:
====================================
Reloading configuration does not reload all configuration items. The items which are reloaded
include:

Services
ACL Tokens
Configuration Entry Bootstrap
Checks
Discard Check Output
HTTP Client Address
Log level
Node Metadata
Watches

Module 43: Consul Monitor:
==========================
The monitor command is used to connect and follow the logs of a running Consul agent.
The amount of logged data depends on the overall logging level.
Available log levels are:
Trace
Debug
Info (default)
Warn
Err

Module 44: Consul Debug:
=======================
The consul debug command monitors a Consul agent for the specified period of time, recording information about the agent, cluster, and environment to an archive written to the current directory.

> consul debug

Consul Snapshot Inspect:
========================
The snapshot inspect command is used to inspect an atomic, point-in-time snapshot of the state of the consul servers.

Version field displays the snapshot format version. This only refers to the stracture of the snapshot, not the data contained within.
> consul snapshot inspect backup.snap

Module 45: Script Checks:
=========================
There are two primary ways of achieving script checks:
Enabling script checks in some configurations may introduce a remote execution vulnerability that is known to be targeted by malware.
It is strongly recommended to use enable_local_script_checks

Configuration Flag                Description
enable_local_script_checks        Enable scripts check defined in local configs file. Script checks defined via the HTTP API will not be allowed.
enable_script_checks              Enable scripts check regardless of how they are defined.

Module 46: Gossip Protocol Uses:
================================
Consul uses a gossip protocol to manage membership and broadcast messages to the cluster.
Membership information allows clients to automatically discover servers, reducing the amount of configuration needed.
The distributed failure detection allows the work of failure detection to be shared by the entire cluster instead of concentrated on a few servers.
The gossip pool allows for reliable and fast event broadcasts.

Module 47: Miscellaneous Pointers:
===================================
The communication between Consul agents is secured using TLS.

Difference between consul keygen and consul keyring!

Consul Snapshot Restores involve a potentially dangerous low-level Raft operation that is not designed to handle server failures during a restore.
This operation is primarily intended to be used when recovering from a disaster, restoring into a fresh cluster of Consul servers.

The WAN pool is globally unique, as all servers should participate in the WAN pool regardless of the data center.
If using multiple WAN joined datacenters, be sure to use the same encryption key in all datacenters.

Consul Enterprise provides the ability to scale clustered Consul servers to include voting andnon-voting servers.
Expanding your Consul cluster in this way can scale reads without impacting write latency.
